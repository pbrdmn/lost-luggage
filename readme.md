# ðŸ§³ Lost Luggage

An interactive choose-your-own adventure text game to play in the terminal.

You, the player, have been travelling and your luggage has been lost. Not only has it been lost, your bag seems to have broken and the contents have spilled into other luggage. You must track down a list of lost luggage in search of your missing belongongs, and in particular a family heirloom ring you were planning on using to propose to your partner.

You have called the airline and they've given you a list of other lost luggage in a number of other cities that you will need to search to find your belongings, and in particular the ring. You have enough time and money to search through all of the cities, but your score will be determined by the total length time and money spent on the flights tracking down your belongings. The game will end when you find the ring.
